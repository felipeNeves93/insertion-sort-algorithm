    If the element is greater than the element to its left, the list is not modified, otherwise, the
    element is moved until it find its correct position.
* **Characteristics**
  * **Time Complexity**
    * Best Case (Nearly Sorted): O(n)
    * Worst Case (Reverse Order): O(n2)
    * Average Case: O(n2)
  * **Stable Sort**: Yes, maintain the relative order of equal elements
* Implementation
